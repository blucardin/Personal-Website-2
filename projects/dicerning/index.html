At the end of the year, the club put together a hackathon (a 48 hour event where programmers compete in teams to build the best computer project).</p><p>I joined the hackathon and was paired up with a team of three other programmers. Going off the hackathon’s topic, education, we designed a Discord bot that would play educational games in chat.</p><p>Discord is a messaging system where in chat groups (servers) you can install third party plugins to interact with using the chat (bots).</p><p>Our bot had several uses like generating a typing speed test, math quiz, or chemistry element quiz. For every quiz you took, you would get points depending on the score you achieved. We also implemented a leaderboard function where the points for each player globally could be shown.</p><p>We ended up winning the competition and receiving the best UI/UX prize.</p><p>A year later, I approached the organizers of the hackathon, and with their help, I organized Recess Hacks 2.0.
