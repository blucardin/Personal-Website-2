## Hello World! 

I just created a personal website for myself. This is not the first website I have created (nor is it the last), but I am still quite proud of it.

## My motivation
There are three main reasons why I created this website:

1. I am a relatively young computer *enthusiast* and I need to prove that I know how to do computer stuff without actually doing too much computer stuff. The easiest way to do this is to create a website.

2. I have seen lots of other people's websites. They all look really cool and *professional*, and who doesn't want to look cool and professional?

3. I wanted a bit of a *personal* log of all the stuff that I have been up to over the years. 

4. **Jobs Applications!**

5. Procrastination on other tasks.
