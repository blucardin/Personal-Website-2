I did a hackathon (programming marathon) where I created an online snake video game by myself. I wanted to test my abilities and I ended up having a lot of fun. 

Users were able to play the snake game, then, once they died, add their score and name to a global leaderboard stored in a CockroachDB database. 

I will be honest, for this side project I stayed up for 36 hours straight coding and was a little loopy when doing the project description and video. But nevertheless, I am proud of how the project turned out and the features I was able to implement in such a short amount of time and low amount of sleep.
