At my school, we have a specialized Wednesday program where students can attend educational sessions outside of school. 

For one Wednesday session, I chose to attend a mini-course on fractals. Unfortunately, I was put online at this time (due to the pandemic) and was unable to participate in the physical fractal building activities. 

So, I decided to code fractals instead. I wrote python scripts to generate different kinds of fractals using pythonâ€™s turtle module. The scripts also explore algorithm efficiency, by using different techniques of generating the same fractal image: depth first, breadth first and random graph traversal.

You can see all the images in gif format along with all the code here: https://github.com/blucardin/fractals
