To learn more about computer science and expand my capabilities as a programmer, I decided to take the CS50x online course. 

CS50x is Harvard University’s introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science.  It teaches you how to solve problems, both with and without code, with an emphasis on correctness, design, and style. Topics include computational thinking, abstraction, algorithms, data structures, and computer science more generally. Problem sets inspired by the arts, humanities, social sciences, and sciences. More than teach you how to program in one language, this course teaches you how to program fundamentally and how to teach yourself new languages ultimately. 

More information about CS50 can be found here: https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/

The course has 11 weeks (each with their own lab and problem set) and a final project: 
	1	Scratch		 
	2	C		
	3	Arrays		
	4	Algorithms		 
	5	Memory		
	6	Data Structures	
	7	Python		 
	8	SQL		 
	9	HTML, CSS, JavaScript
	10	Flask
	11	Emoji

To pass the course, I was required to complete all coursework (problem sets, labs, and the final project) with full marks. 
I learned a lot and I am happy that I took CS50x. I was so moved by the incredible problem sets and teaching style, I decided to teach my own CS50x class at my school. 

My CS50x certificate is part of this pdf and can be found here: https://cs50.harvard.edu/certificates/d11d2bd4-98d3-4f69-8172-8737ee188045
