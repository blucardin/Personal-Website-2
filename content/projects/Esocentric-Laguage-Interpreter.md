I wanted to try my hand at writing an interpreter for a programming language. After conducting some research, I found a simple language called “Brainfuck” that emulated a turing machine using only 8 distinct commands. 

I wrote the code on the weekend and enjoyed the project. It was surprisingly challenging.
