I'm Noah, an aspiring software developer from Toronto, Canada.

## My motivation for this site
There are three main reasons why I created this website:

1. I am a relatively young computer *enthusiast* and I need to prove that I know how to do computer stuff without actually doing too much computer stuff. The easiest way to do this is to create a website.

2. I have seen lots of other people's websites. They all look really cool and *professional*, and who doesn't want to look cool and professional?

3. I wanted a bit of a *personal* log of all the stuff that I have been up to over the years. 

4. **Job Applications!** Websites look cool, don't they? 

5. Procrastination on other tasks.

I hope you enjoy poking around.

Like most personal blogs, this site is constantly out of date with all the fun stuff I'm currently doing. Mostly because I'm too busy doing the fun stuff to update it.
