I am a ~~grade 12 high school student~~ aspiring developer in Toronto, Canada. I like helping people, solving problems, and doing cool things. 

My best projects so far are a [video display made of addressable Christmas Lights](/projects/christmas-lights-v2) and an [analytics dashboard](/projects/ers-dashboard). 

I also have done some [fractal stuff](/projects/fractals) if you want something cool to look at.

I mostly work in python, but I also know Javascipt (for web development), java (for school), and C (when I want to confuse myself). 

Currently, I'm looking into AI stuff, it seems trendy.

Like most personal blogs, this site is constantly out of date with all the fun stuff I'm currently doing. Mostly because I'm too busy doing the fun stuff to update it.
