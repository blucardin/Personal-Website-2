###Warning
I apologize in advance for the spelling mistakes. I am writing this on a plane, and I do not have access to auto complete software. I am raking my brain on how to spell blater (blatter, blaghter, blauter, I give up!)

#Intro
I have a lot of questions, all the time. 

I usually bug my family with these "fish-blater" questions. They usually brush me off, saying something like, "Noah, I don't know", or, "Noah, I don't care", and on occasion, "Noah, I am extremely annoyed by these outrageous questions". 

The term "fish blatter" comes from a large argument had over me asking "If fish blatters expand when fishers bring them up from great depths (sometimes coming out of their mouths) due to the great pressure underwater compressing the air being released as they are reeled to the surface, where does the air come from when those fish are born?"

I still do not know the answer for this question, but I hypothesize that they have a mechanism in their blaghters that extracts the oxygen/nitrogen diffused in the water and stores it in their fish-blauter. 

#Reasons

After I found out that I couldn't bug my family with these questions, I had a need for answers, and couldn't be bothered to find them out myself. As well as this, I had to actually do work 

I set up a twitter
